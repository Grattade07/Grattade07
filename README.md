:mortar_board: Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and create various web pages/apps

ðŸŒ± Having taught myself the basics of programming by following The Odin Project's curriculum I am currently completing a Web Development bootcamp run by HyperionDev with the hope of transitioning careers into a Junior Web Dev role.

If you'd like to look at one of my most recent projects you can find it here: [Repo](https://github.com/Grattade07/finalCapstone) [Hosted Page](https://grattade07.github.io/finalCapstone/)
Here are some other projects that I built whilst working through The Odin Project:
* **Calculator**: [Repo](https://github.com/Grattade07/Calculator) [Hosted Page](https://grattade07.github.io/Calculator/)
* **Browser-based Rock-Paper-Scissors**: [Repo](https://github.com/Grattade07/Rock-Paper-Scissors) [Hosted Page](https://grattade07.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)
