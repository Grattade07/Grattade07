:mortar_board: Iâ€™m interested in progressing my ability to write code following best practices to create applications that provide a great user experience and solve problems.

ðŸŒ± Having taught myself programming through online resources and completing a bootcamp provided by HyperionDev, I am currently working to create intuitive applications at Cordic.

If you'd like to look at one of my most recent projects you can find it here: [(Repo)](https://github.com/Grattade07/car-database) [(Hosted Page)](https://car-database-83rb.onrender.com)
